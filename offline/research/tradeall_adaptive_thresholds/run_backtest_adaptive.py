An investigation (23 Jul 2026): does it make sense to promote vol_1h_pct from shadow_signals
la o decizie REALA in tradeall.py, inlocuind pragurile FIXE de detectie a
of the price move (PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD_EUR / PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD_BIG_EUR,
used by check_price_change() for the SMALL/BIG windows) with ADAPTIVE thresholds
(K * vol_1h_pct, the same formula as shadow_signals.vol_1h_pct)?

Context (answering the user question "did we not do this because of the backtest?"):
There is NO earlier backtest that tests EXACTLY this idea.
offline/research/tradeall_trigger_gate/ (21-22 iul) a testat ALTE tipuri de schimbari —
relaxing the start/confirmation conditions of a trend that has already begun, a cooldown,
a quality signal on a 24h regression — and none beat the current variant
plus buy & hold over 329 days. But NONE of those variants replaced
the FIXED thresholds with ones scaled on REALISED volatility — this is a new
idea, analogous to the successful promotion of the adaptive re-entry threshold on Kraken
(offline/research/kraken_adaptive_thresholds/), merely applied to a different mechanism.

Methodology (the same rigour as offline/research/kraken_adaptive_thresholds/ and
Experiment 6 in tradeall_trigger_gate/):
  - Istoric REAL, 329 zile (cache_price_{symbol}.jsonl, ~7 min/tick).
  - check_price_change() itself is NOT modified — only the threshold value
    sent is replaced with K*vol_1h_pct, computed from EXACTLY the same window
    BIG window also used by shadow_signals.vol_1h_pct (real history, not separately simulated).
  - FALLBACK onto the real FIXED thresholds (from config, NOT arbitrary values) when
    warm-up (<20 points in the BIG window) — the same fail-safe pattern as in
    Kraken (STRAT_REENTRY_ADAPTIVE): an unavailable signal does not stop or alter
    the trading, it merely falls back to the fixed value.
  - K_BIG = K_SMALL * RATIO, unde RATIO = pragul BIG fix / pragul SMALL fix de
    today (~4.79) — we keep the ratio between the windows so as not to introduce a second
    an untested dimension in the sweep (the same principle as on Kraken: reentry and
    DCA tested SEPARATELY, each with a single multiplier).
  - Comparatie: PnL net (realizat + mark-to-market - comisioane) vs varianta
    the FIXED one (the default K) and against buy & hold, on BOTH symbols (BTC, TAO).

It reuses offline.backtests.tradeall.run_backtest() through the `threshold_provider` hook
(added 23 Jul as part of this investigation) — it no longer copies the
tick. Before this hook, this file had its own copy of the loop from
run_backtest() (a risk of silent drift from the "official" engine if that one
changes later — see offline/research/BACKTEST_CANDIDATES.md and the discussion in
session about unifying the backtests). The refactor was verified to
reproduce the old loop's results BIT FOR BIT, on real data, before
a inlocui vechea implementare.
