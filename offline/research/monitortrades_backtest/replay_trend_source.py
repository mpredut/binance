"""replay_trend_source.py — a trend signal computed from the REPLAYED history (not from
cache_instant_trend.json, which is written LIVE), for monitortrades backtests.

It uses EXACTLY the same PriceWindow class (pricewindow.py) and formula
(get_instant_trend: (slope_full + gradient_recent)/2 -> semn) ca live
(cacheManager.py, after the 29 Jul race fix — see below; identical also to
tradeall.handle_symbol's own formula), fed by hand from the replay ticks
— the same pattern already used by offline/backtests/tradeall.py for its windows.

Why we do NOT model "tradeall absent": tradeall.py ALWAYS runs live (it is not an
optional process) — so this signal is always available, exactly as in live. Neutral
(gradient≈0) appears ONLY when the market itself has no clear direction in the
chosen window, never as a fallback for a process that might not be running.

Context (29 iul, investigatie cursa fast/slow in cacheManager.py): masurat empiric
pe istoric real ca cele 2 cai (rapida=get_recent_gradient simplu, lenta=
the rich get_instant_trend) differ in SIGN on 14.9% (BTC) / 21.0% (TAO) of the ticks,
and the fast path alone changes its sign on 32-35% of the ticks (a window too
mica/zgomotoasa pt un semnal de "trend" stabil). Fix aplicat live (cacheManager.py,
not yet committed at that date): the fast path no longer writes gradient_recent/final_trend,
only the slow path does. This module REPLICATES the slow-path formula (get_instant_trend),
the only one that reaches is_trend_up() in monitortrades.py today.

Parameterised on the window length (window_seconds) — 3 distinct horizons, ALL
valid (a user decision: they are not unified into a single one, each trading model
uses what suits it):
  - "instant"  ~3.7 min (the default, identical to WINDOW_SECONDS[0] in
                cacheManager.CachePriceShortTrendManager — what is_trend_up() reads today)
  - "mediu"    ~1.5-6h  (orizontul "big" al lui tradeall, slope_big — azi nepublicat
                cross-process, but computable identically here for A/B tests)
  - "long"     not defined yet (the exact window remains to be decided; supported generically
                through the same window_seconds parameter, with no default)
