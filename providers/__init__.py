"""Unified market-data and execution-provider adapters.

``market_api`` owns the routing facade, the Binance fallback adapter, and the shared
``api`` instance. Kraken and Trading 212 are selected explicitly by instrument
configuration; Hyperliquid claims its supported HYPE symbol forms. This package does
not eagerly import ``market_api`` because provider registration would form an import
cycle. Consumers normally import ``api`` from ``providers.market_api`` directly.
