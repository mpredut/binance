"""Order-safe HTTP retry mounting, shared across provider clients.

DNS/connection blips (e.g. "Failed to resolve <host>" during a VPN or resolver
hiccup) happen BEFORE a request is sent, so retrying a *connect* failure can never
re-send a POST that already reached the venue and placed a real-money order. That
connect-only profile is therefore safe for any HTTP method and is the default here.

Read/status retries cover transient read errors and retryable status codes on
GET-class (idempotent) requests only: urllib3's default ``allowed_methods`` excludes
POST, so an order POST is never replayed. NEVER widen allowed_methods to include POST.

Used by the Hyperliquid SDK session (all requests are POST -> connect-only) and the
python-binance client session (GET reads also retry on read/status, POST orders stay
connect-only). Kraken uses its own ``http_post_form`` layer rather than a
``requests.Session`` and is not wired here; its DNS is covered by the systemd-resolved
cache (see systemd/DNS_RESILIENCE.md).
