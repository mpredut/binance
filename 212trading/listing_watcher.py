listing_watcher.py — GENERIC component that waits until an asset becomes tradable.

Decoupled from the strategy and any specific asset. For ANY new IPO, listing, or
reactivated ticker, wait for real volume or moving prices without mistaking a
pre-listing placeholder for trading. Reused by t212_bot.py for every awaited asset.
